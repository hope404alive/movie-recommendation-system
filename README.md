# Movie Recommendation System using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity

This repository contains code for a movie recommendation system implemented using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity. The system takes a movie title as input and recommends similar movies based on their content, which includes the movie title and genre.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-tfidf.git
   cd movie-recommendation-tfidf
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the `movie_recommendation.py` script to load the dataset, preprocess data, and create the recommendation system.

2. Use the `get_recommendations` function to get movie recommendations:
   ```python
   recommended_movies = get_recommendations("Avatar", cosine_sim, df)
   print(recommended_movies)
   ```
